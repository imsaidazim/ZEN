                <p class="s2-p">ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you whenever your electronic devices start failing after the standard warranty ends, which is pretty common.
                <br> <br>
                When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping Mastercard®, their warranty gets extended by one year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.

You can rest assured we’ll handle all of the transaction-related problems faster and with higher success rates. Where lone consumers can be ignored or dumped by dishonest merchants, ZEN doesn't get discouraged. ZEN persists.

                <p class="s6-p">Online shopping is flawed with all kind of fees. Currency exchange fees, processing fees and even fees for having multiple fees. Getting rid of them became our hobby. Same goes for ATM withdrawal fees.
                    <br> <br>
                Enjoy your money globally. Every uncut part of it. Keep reading. ZEN goes beyond shopping with a fully functional account.
